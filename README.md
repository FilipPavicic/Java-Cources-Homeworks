# Java Cources Homeworks
Homework tasks from courses "Selected Topics in Software Development 1" and "Selected Topics in Software Development 2", led by Professor Marko Čupić.
Through these complex and useful homework tasks, I gained valuable knowledge in advanced Java programming, algorithms and data structures, design patterns, parallel programming in Java, and general software development.
